# Replication scripts

This directory contains R scripts to reproduce the results, tables, and figures in our paper, for the three example dynamic systems:

  * Hes1 oscillation system
  * FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN) system
  * Protein transduction (PTrans) system

## Protein transduction system

Run the script `replicate-ptrans-lownoise.R` to reproduce the results of the low noise scenario, using the same 100 simulated datasets as in the paper.

Run the script `replicate-ptrans-highnoise.R` to reproduce the results of the high noise scenario, using the same 100 simulated datasets as in the paper.
