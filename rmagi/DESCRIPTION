Description: Provides fast and accurate inference for the parameter estimation problem in Ordinary Differential
    Equations, including the case when there are unobserved system components. Implements the MAGI method
    (MAnifold-constrained Gaussian process Inference) of Yang, Wong, and Kou (2021) <doi:10.1073/pnas.2020397118>.
